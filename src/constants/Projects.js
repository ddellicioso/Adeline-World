        contribution:`Throughout the project, I contributed in every phase, including research and interviews, 
        empathy mapping, ideation, prototyping, and development. However, my main responsibility was as the 
        lead developer during the development phase. I managed the team's collaboration on Git, developed 
        the back-end AI features, integrated them with the front-end, and implemented the functionality for 
        displaying the generated visual contents.`,
